# SQLLoggingScriptSample
This is a sample logging script used in a workshop I conducted.  Code is placed here as a non production sample.


TODO:

1. Document the process
2. Remove MASTER as the branch name and make Main the "Main"


This is the public repo.  Bit of a rush to put in, but has some examples.  The MainLogging Framework, 1_CreateLoggingFramework.sql,  has the table creation and stored proc creation.  There is also testing scripts in there that provide examples.  
The 3_Import_Data_DEV.sql script has an example of some audit information, number of rows before and after.

It has been a couple of years, but I always liked to have my own audit table to put a PowerBI report against so I could do some audit of the ETL process.  This all goes back to my SSIS days.

Hope it helps, let me know on linkedin.
